# Operaatio Anthophila - Python Text Adventure

A Python-based text adventure game set in a dystopian future. Players explore a post-apocalyptic world, collect items, solve challenges, and restore a greenhouse to survive.

## Overview

The game was developed as a final project for a Python course, applying learned concepts such as dictionaries, lists, classes/objects, functions, file handling, sets, and conditional statements. The project aimed for the highest grade by creating a fully playable game with at least 20 locations, 8 items, 5 additional commands, and a points system.

The game emphasizes logical story structure, inventory management, player stats (oxygen levels, injuries), and exploration challenges, including a mechanism to track paths and simulate getting lost in the world.

The game was inspired by post-apocalyptic and dystopian fiction, but all story elements, locations, and characters are original creations.

The game is in finnish.

## Features

- Player inventory and stats: track items, equipment, points, oxygen, and movement in the wasteland.
- Exploration of 20+ locations with branching directions (north, south, east, west).
- Item collection and usage to solve puzzles and complete objectives.
- Multiple game mechanics: health and oxygen consumption, hazards, and optional alternate endings.
- Modular Python design:
  - peli.py – main game loop and command handling
  - pelaaja.py – player class storing stats, items, equipment, and movement
  - paikat.py – world data, location descriptions, available items, and movement options
- Text files for story elements, intros, and location descriptions.
- Enhanced gameplay features: e.g., skip intro, limit points to prevent scoring exploits, and dynamic object interactions.

## Gameplay

1. Run the game:
   ```
   python peli.py
   ```
2. Navigate using cardinal directions, collect items, and restore the greenhouse to win.
3. Manage oxygen levels, equipment, and inventory to survive the wasteland.

## Development Notes

- Inspired by dystopian themes and environmental concerns.
- Focused on combining Python programming skills with creative game design.
- Developed incrementally: initial planning, then code modularization for maintainability.
- Testing included solving gameplay issues like point duplication and path-tracking.
- Demonstrates ability to implement object-oriented programming, modular code, and file-based data management.

## Highlights & Feedback

- Developed a large, balanced, and ambitious game project, demonstrating goal-oriented Python learning.
- Used Python features comprehensively, including dictionaries, lists, classes/objects, functions, sets, and conditional statements.
- Modular code structure and use of classes/functions were well thought out and effective.
- Gameplay design included multiple locations, inventory, branching choices, and resource management.
- Small improvements noted by instructor: command handling could be streamlined, and file reading optimized; overall implementation was excellent.

## Role

- Sole developer: responsible for game design, story, coding, and debugging.
- Applied problem-solving, Python programming, and creative design skills.
